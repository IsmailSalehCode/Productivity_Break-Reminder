Desktop timer app with two modes: Work and Rest. User can:
1. Toggle b/w a light and dark theme.
2. Set the work & rest durations (both capped at 24h).
3. Select whether or not they want:
   - The app window to be minimized when the timer starts running.
   - A balloon pop-up to appear + sound in the taskbar upon timer elapse.
   - The app window to be maximized upon timer elapse.
5. Select background color when:
   - The timer is running.
   - The timer is paused.

**TODOs**
- Implementations of requirements 1. and 5. can conflict with each other. Resolve that.
- New setting: Auto-start on user login?

After I finish all TODOs an installer will be provided in a public repo. The `README.MD` of the public repo will have a manual with screenshots of the app.
