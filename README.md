Timer app with two modes: Work and Rest. User can:
1. Toggle the theme of the app
2. Set the work & rest durations (both capped at 24h).
3. Select whether or not they want:
   - The app window to be minimized upon timer start.
   - A balloon pop-up to appear + sound in the taskbar upon timer elapse.
   - The app window to be maximized upon timer elapse.
5. Select background color when:
   - The timer is running.
   - The timer is paused.

**Current issue**: Requirements 1) and 4 can conflict with each other.

After I resolve this issue this repo will be set to private and an installer will be provided in a public repo. The `README.MD` of the public repo will have a manual with screenshots of the app.
